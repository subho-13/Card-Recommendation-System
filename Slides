Credit Cards
	-> stable source of income for the Banks.
In Wells Fargo
	-> Quarter 2 of this Financial Year
	-> 34% of Customer Lending Revenue
	-> So the Card Recommender system that we're building should be able to
		-> Can Attract new users
		-> Can retain existing users
		-> Provide suggestions that are customer centric	
-> We made a few assumptions
-> Also, we had to consider a few constraints while building our system

Building such a Recommendation System brings forth an array of Challenges
	-> Scalability
		-> Scale up the operations cost effectively as more customers start using the system
	-> Adaptability
		-> Adapt and personalize the recommendations w.r.t to the changing lifestyle of the customer
	-> Privacy
		-> Ensure that the sensitive customer information is handled safely and securely and it's confidentiality is maintained
		
Now that we know the challenges we're trying to address, Sabuj will now discuss about the System Architecture

In the Redeem Reward Points Microservice
	-> Product database contains a list of -> premium as well as basic <- products and services.
-> These Products are suggested to the users based on their reward points in the associated categories. 
-> For evaluation purposes, we are considering a customer, whose profession is 'Student' and has rewards points of about 81 - hundred
-> Now, the plot shows Categories like Education and Shopping involves maximum expenditure. 
-> So, recommending the 'Book voucher' and 'Nike shoes' as the top suggestions seem to be quite reasonable.
-> Another product, the 'Dell laptop' has also been suggested. 
-> This has a slightly greater reward points requirement.
-> This is so, because the user may take it up as a target
	-> And decide to save the reward points rather than spending them all on other products.
