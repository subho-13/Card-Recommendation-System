-> Before we look into the objectives, let's look at the landscape
Credit Cards
	-> stable source of income for the Banks.
In Wells Fargo
	-> Quarter 2 of this Financial Year
	-> 34% of Customer Lending Revenue came from the Credit Cards line of business
	-> So the Card Recommendation system that we're building should be able to
		-> Can Attract new users
		-> Can retain existing users
		-> Provide suggestions that are customer centric	
-> We made a few assumptions
	-> Every Customer has an initial credit card
	-> Credit scores of the customers are available
-> Also, we had to consider a few constraints
	-> Tagged Credit Cards Data was unavailable
	-> No suitable evaluation metric for the Recommendation Models

Building such a Recommendation System brings forth an array of Challenges
	-> Scalability
		-> Scale up the operations cost effectively as more customers start using the system
	-> Adaptability
		-> Adapt and personalize the recommendations w.r.t to the changing lifestyle of the customer
	-> Privacy
		-> Ensure that the sensitive customer information is handled safely and securely
		-> It's confidentiality is maintained
		
Now that we know the challenges we're trying to address, next we will discuss more about the System Architecture

Next we come to the Suggestions to Redeem the accrued Reward Points
	-> We have a product database which contains a list of
		-> premium as well as some basic products.
	-> These Products are suggested to the users 
		-> based on their reward points in the associated categories. 
-> For evaluation purposes, 
	-> we are considering a customer
	-> whose profession is 'Student'
	-> has rewards points of about 8000
-> The plot on the left shows that
	-> There is maximum expenditure in the Categories of Education and Shopping
-> So, recommendation of
	-> 'Book voucher' and 'Nike shoes' 
	-> seem to be quite reasonable.
-> Another product, the 'Dell laptop' has also been suggested. 
-> This has a slightly greater reward points requirement.
-> However we suggested this
	-> because the user may take it up as a target
	-> And decide to save the reward points rather than spend them on other products.
