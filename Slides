	-> 34% of Customer Lending Revenue
	-> So the Card Recommender system that we're building should be able to
		-> Can Attract new users
		-> Can retain existing users
		-> Provide suggestions that are customer centric	
-> We made a few assumptions
-> Also, we had to consider a few constraints while building our system

Building such a Recommendation System brings forth an array of Challenges
	-> Scalability
		-> Scale up the operations cost effectively as more customers start using the system
	-> Adaptability
		-> Adapt and personalize the recommendations w.r.t to the changing lifestyle of the customer
	-> Privacy
		-> Ensure that the sensitive customer information is handled safely and securely and it's confidentiality is maintained
		
Now that we know the challenges we're trying to address, Sabuj will now discuss about the System Architecture
