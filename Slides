Credit Cards are a stable source of income for the Banks.
In Wells Fargo, in the Quarter 2 of Financial Year 2021
	-> roughly 34% of Customer Lending Revenue from the Credit Card line of business
	-> So the Card Recommender system that we're building should be able to
		-> Can Attract new users
		-> Can retain existing users
		-> Provide suggestions that are customer centric

Now, building such a Recommendation System brings forth the following Challenges
	-> Scalability
		-> Scale up the operations as more customers start using the system
	-> Adaptability
		-> Adapt and personalize the recommendations w.r.t to the changing lifestyle of the customer
	-> Privacy
		-> Ensure that the sensitive customer information is handled safely and securely and it's confidentiality is maintained

One of our primary challenges were to make the Recommendation System scalable. Scalability 
	-> handle increasing and dynamic workload 
	-> By adding new resources and functionalities 
	-> in a cost effective manner

To measure the scalability, we'll use the Scale Cube Model.

In the scale cube model, the axes represent the scalability strategies
	-> The X Axis represents scaling by replication of microservice instances
	-> Y Axis represents scaling through Componentization of the Architecture
	-> Z Axis represents scaling through Federation

	-> Architecture is X Axis scalable because 
		-> The microservices are loosely coupled as Producers and Consumers
		-> They are internally stateless
		-> Thus N - Identical microservices can be used to handle the incoming events parallely 
		

	-> Architecture follows the Y axis scaling strategy because
		-> Each microservice has a Bounded Context
		-> The Architecture is composed of a set of disjoint microservices

	-> Architecture is also Z axis scalable. 
	-> It runs on top of Apache Kafka supports key based topic partioning

We'll take the scale cube approach to determine 
The microservices
