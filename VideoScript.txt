-> At first, The Kafka Server is initialized
-> Then, we're performing some clean-Up operations
-> After that we're starting the following servers
-> Next, we're starting the following unsupervised models
-> Then, we're starting a XGBoost Model
		-> Trainer
		-> Generator Service
		
-> And finally the UI and the Transaction Driver.
-> The Transaction Driver is sending the Transactions to the Data Collector
    
-> So, right now we can see that we've received no recommendations from the models
-> What we're waiting for is the first Trigger to these models to generate the recommendations 
-> And here have we recieved one
	-> We can see that recommendations are being streamed from the Rule Learning and New User Model
-> But not Other Models 
	-> These models require a few more transactions to start generating good recommendations. 
	-> So, waiting for more Triggers
-> Now, if we check once again, all the unsupervised models are now  generating recommendations
-> In the meantime, The XGBoost model is waiting to getting trained from these recommendations
-> And here, we've trained our first model
-> The Nearline Scheduler is also sending the triggers
-> And we should recieve recommendations from the XGBoost models and we're receiving them
-> So, all these recommendations are then getting compiled in the Recommendation Compiler
-> Which is further sending it to the Provider service, acting as a backend for the UI
-> Now, let's check the results for the Users from the UI
	Customer with ID 1 has been suggested the Visa Signature card 
		-> because of good credit scores
		-> high expenditure in the Category of Grocery and Health
	Customer with ID 10 has been suggested the Entertainment as the complimentary card
		-> since the user already has the Shopping Card,
		-> high expenditure in the Category of in the Entertainment and Food
	Customer with ID 31 has been suggested the Cash Wise Card 
		-> because of relatively high expenditure in Grocery and Shopping

And with that we've come to the end of this Demo
