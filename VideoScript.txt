-> At first, The Kafka Server is initialized
-> Then, we're performing some clean-Up operations
-> After that we're starting the following servers
	-> Data Collector
	-> Data Abstraction
	-> Feature Extraction
	-> Offline Scheduler
	-> Nearline Scheduler
	-> Recommendation Compiler
	-> Recommendation Provider
	-> Reward Suggestions
	-> Redeem Reward Points
	
-> We're running the following unsupervised models
	-> New User Model
	-> Rule Learning
	-> Association Rule Learning
	-> Self Organizing Maps
	-> Kpca Similarity
	-> Neural Embedding
-> And then we're starting the
	-> XGBoost
		-> Trainer
		-> Generator Service
		
-> And finally the UI and the Transaction Driver.
-> The Transaction Driver is sending the Transactions to the Data Collector
    
-> So, right now we can see that we've received no recommendations from the models
-> What we're waiting for is the first Trigger to these models to generate the recommendations 
-> And we recieved one and Here, we have the recommendations
	-> from the Rule Learning and New User Model
-> But not Other Models 
	-> These models require a few more transactions to start generating good recommendations. 
	-> So, waiting for more Triggers
-> Now, if we check once again, all the unsupervised models are now  generating recommendations
-> Question is what about the xgboost models?
-> The XGBoost model is waiting to getting trained from these recommendations
-> And here, we've trained our first model
-> Okay, the Xgboost Scheduler is also sending the triggers
-> And lo! The XGBoost models have also started generating Recommendations
-> So, after that all these recommendations are getting compiled in the Recommendation Compiler, which is further sending it to the Provider service, acting as a backend for the UI
-> Now, if check the results for the Users from the UI
