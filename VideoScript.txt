At first, we'll run the initialization script.
This will initiate the Kafka Server
Then it will some clean-up operations from previous run.

After that it starts launching the different servers, as you can see.

At first the
	-> DataCollector service comes online
	-> Then the Data Abstraction
	-> Feature Extraction
	-> Offline Scheduler
	-> Nearline Scheduler
	-> Recommendation Compiler
	-> Recommendation Provider
	-> Reward Suggestion
	-> And the Reward Redeem Service
	
After that we start our 
	-> Offline Unsupervised Recommendation Generator services
	-> Followed by the Nearline Supervised Trainer Service
	-> And the Nearline Supervised Generator Service.

Due to Hardware contraints, We're running only a subset of the models
	-> New User Model
	-> Rule Learning Model
	-> Association Rule Learning Model
	-> Self Organizing Maps Model
	-> Neural Embedding Model
	-> And the XGBoost Model

Finally, Our Driver Starts streaming in The Transactions

Now,
	-> The Unsupervised Models are waiting for the Offline Triggers
	-> And the Supervised Models are waiting to get trained to become Operational
	
-> Oh wait, Here we got our First Trigger
	-> The New User Models responded
	-> The Rule Learning Model also responsed to it
	-> But what about the Rest?
		-> They're actually waiting to have enough Old Users before they feasibily start generating recommendations
	-> After a Few Triggers
		-> Oh They Did!

-> It's about time that the Nearline Supervised Trainer starts Cooking a XGBoost Model
	-> The Trainer trained a XGBoost Model
	-> And Sent it to the Generator Service
	
-> After Receiving Nearline Triggers from the Nearline Scheduler
	-> The XGBoost Model also starts generating the Recommendations
	
-> The Compiler compiles all these Recommendations periodically
	-> And then Sends it to Recommendation Provider

-> Now, let's see the Final Recommendations and the Product Suggestions
